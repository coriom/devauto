PATCH OBJECTIVE (TOP PRIORITY):
Refactor src/main.py to be clean, minimal, and deterministic.
Ask ONLY ONE question (the first valid question in src/questions.txt) and print "Score: X/1".

SCOPE:
- Modify ONLY: src/main.py
- Do NOT modify src/questions.txt, src/testsite/*, or any other file.

FORMAT GUARANTEE (MATCH CURRENT questions.txt):
- Ignore blank lines and lines starting with '#'
- Questions are separated by a line that is exactly: ---
- Each block uses:
  Q: <text>
  A) <text>
  B) <text>
  C) <text>
  D) <text>
  ANS: <A|B|C|D>

STRICT RULES:
- Remove all duplicated / conflicting definitions in src/main.py:
  - Exactly ONE Question dataclass
  - Exactly ONE ask_choice
  - Exactly ONE parse_questions
  - Exactly ONE run_quiz
  - Exactly ONE main
- No unreachable code, no second parser, no second return paths.
- Keep safe input handling:
  - Only accept A/B/C/D (strip + upper)
  - On EOFError or KeyboardInterrupt: exit cleanly with no traceback.

TARGET IMPLEMENTATION:
- @dataclass(frozen=True) class Question:
    prompt: str
    options: dict[str, str]
    answer: str
- read_questions_file(path: str) -> str
- parse_questions(text: str) -> list[Question]
  - use ONLY the '---' separator logic
  - enforce that all A/B/C/D exist and ANS is valid
- ask_choice(prompt: str) -> str (loop until valid)
- run_quiz(q: Question) -> int (ask ONLY this single question)
- main():
  - read src/questions.txt (same path logic as today)
  - parse questions
  - if no valid question -> print an error and return non-zero
  - else take the first question only, run it, print "Score: X/1", return 0/1

PATCH STYLE (IMPORTANT):
- If src/main.py is currently messy (duplicate defs etc.), DO NOT attempt multiple replace patches.
- Prefer a single "write" op to rewrite src/main.py entirely with the clean minimal implementation above.
- Keep imports minimal (only needed stdlib).

DONE WHEN:
- Running `python src/main.py` asks exactly ONE question and prints "Score: X/1"
- src/main.py contains no duplicate definitions.
